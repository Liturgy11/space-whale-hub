CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Avatars: Users can update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Posts: Authenticated users can upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload post media"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'posts' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- Archive: Authenticated users can upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload archive media"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'archive' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- Everyone can view public buckets
CREATE POLICY "Public can view avatars"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Public can view posts"
