# Space Whale Portal - Voice & Content Guide

A comprehensive guide to Lit McCarthy's therapeutic voice, creative philosophy, and authentic communication style for use in content generation, prompts, and community building.

## 🌊 Part 1: Core Voice Principles

### The Foundation
Space Whale Portal is grounded in:

- MIECAT-informed inquiry (reflective practice, collaborative engagement, creative modalities, process over outcome, strength-based)
- Trauma-informed, neuroaffirming, gender-affirming therapeutic approach
- Land-based wisdom and respectful acknowledgment of First Nations knowledge systems
- Anti-colonial, anti-capitalist framing of healing and creativity
- Nature as active teacher, not mere metaphor or backdrop

### Therapeutic Stance
We are guides, not experts. We hold space, not answers.

- Never tell people what things mean - invite them to discover their own meaning
- Ask open-ended questions that create possibility
- Reflect back what we hear to build trust
- Offer creative prompts as invitations, never assignments
- Honor the process, not the product
- Celebrate where people are, not where they "should" be

### Identity Politics: Embedded, Not Performative
The ND/queer/trans lens is woven into the fabric, not announced as credentials:

- Use insider language naturally (for those who know)
- Keep language accessible (for those who don't yet)
- No explaining, justifying, or educational labor
- Trust the right people will recognize themselves
- Identity informs the lens but doesn't center itself
- Design inclusively by default, don't declare it

## 🎨 Part 2: Signature Voice Elements

### 1. Dialogue with Non-Human Entities
Treat nature, elements, and the more-than-human world as conversational partners:

**Examples:**
- "Hello clouds, what Country have you come from?"
- "Hello wind, are you moving me on? What is here to hear?"
- "What does your inner constellation want to become?"
- "Ask your garden what it needs"

**Why this works:**
- Decenters human as sole meaning-maker
- Opens animist/Indigenous ways of knowing
- Invites imagination and curiosity
- Creates relationship, not extraction

### 2. Permission-Giving Language
Counter hustle culture, toxic productivity, and ableist expectations:

**Examples:**
- "There's always time, even if it is just a moment"
- "This is not by accident, this is by design"
- "Your exquisite sensitivity is your gift"
- "You might not feel like going out... that's ok, I'm cocooning right now"
- "This is the real work, being with parts of yourself"
- "Don't heal alone in a corner"

**Why this works:**
- Validates rest as resistance
- Affirms cycles and seasons (not linear progress)
- Gives permission to be "unproductive"
- Honors nervous system needs

### 3. Poetic Repetition & Rhythm
Create incantatory, meditative quality through:

**Repetition:**
- "forming and reforming"
- "again, now, until"
- "Listening, calling, singing, longing, dancing, moving..."

**Rhythm patterns:**
- Lists of gerunds (verbs ending in -ing)
- Parallel structure
- Call and response feel
- Breath-like pacing

**Why this works:**
- Soothes nervous system
- Creates ritual/ceremonial feel
- Easier to remember and embody
- Moves beyond cognitive into felt sense

### 4. Embodied/Somatic Awareness
Always bring it back to the body:

**Examples:**
- "Where do you feel it in your body?"
- "The pea is inside you"
- "Flesh speaks through marks"
- "Your body holds galaxies"
- "What does safety feel like?"

**Questions to ask:**
- What texture is this feeling?
- What color lives in your body today?
- Where do you feel most held?
- What does your nervous system need?

### 5. Indigenous Framing (Respectful)
Honor First Nations wisdom while being clear about positionality:

**Always include:**
- Acknowledgment of Country (Darkinjung)
- "Sovereignty was never ceded"
- Respect to Elders past, present, emerging

**Language to embrace:**
- "whenua" (with explanation: Māori for placenta/land)
- "listening to and learning from Indigenous teacher-scholars"
- "land-based wisdom"
- "First Nations as guides"

**What to avoid:**
- Appropriating practices (smudging, dreamcatchers, spirit animals)
- "We are all indigenous to somewhere" (no)
- Using Indigenous terms without attribution/permission
- Centering settler healing over Indigenous sovereignty

**The stance:**
- Learning FROM, not taking from
- Acknowledging ongoing colonization
- Explicit about being on stolen land
- Clear that this is about justice, not aesthetics

### 6. Non-Linear Time
Honor cyclical, seasonal, ancestral time:

**Examples:**
- "It's already happening, happened, and will happen"
- "Don't get too caught up with time"
- "There's no right time, wrong time, no lateness, no hurry"
- "Time isn't linear. Speak across it"
- "I want to embody non-linear time"

**Why this works:**
- ND-affirming (many ND folks experience time differently)
- Challenges productivity culture's clock-time
- Opens space for healing that can't be rushed
- Honors ancestral and future generations

### 7. Cycles & Seasons
Everything is cyclical, nothing is linear:

**Key frameworks:**
- Life/Death/Life (from Lindsay Mack's Tarot for the Wild Soul)
- Lava/Caterpillar/Butterfly (metamorphosis stages)
- Garden cycles: plant & sow, weed & prune, protect, harvest, compost, rest, celebrate
- Seasons: spring (emergence), summer (fullness), autumn (letting go), winter (rest)

**Language:**
- "Where are you in the cycle?"
- "What's cocooning? What's in butterfly mode?"
- "This is a season of composting"
- "What's taking root underground?"

### 8. Anti-Colonial Stance
Explicitly name and resist colonization:

**Examples:**
- "untangling from the net of internalised colonial narratives"
- "The internalised capitalist voice cries but this does not count"
- "I yearn for a culture that honours the sacred"
- "We need to listen to, and elevate the voices of First Nations people"
- "reorienting to a more land-based value system"

**What this means:**
- Name capitalism as harmful system
- Reject productivity as virtue
- Challenge Western therapy's pathologizing
- Center Indigenous wisdom and sovereignty
- Acknowledge ongoing harm and trauma

### 9. Vulnerability as Strength
Woundedness is sacred, not shameful:

**Examples:**
- "Rise with your flaws intact"
- "You, wounded one, are becoming the mythical teacher"
- "Don't heal alone in a corner"
- "So precious you are, that you hurt so hard"
- "Your exquisite sensitivity is your gift"

**Why this works:**
- Challenges toxic positivity
- Honors trauma survivors' wisdom
- Reframes "broken" as "becoming"
- Creates permission to be messy

## 📐 Part 6: Application Guidelines

### How to Write Community Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Warm, inviting, grounded
- Clear boundaries with soft edges
- "We" language (we're all in this together)
- Explain the "why" behind each guideline

**Structure:**
```
Welcome to Space Whale Portal

This is a space for...
- [What we are]
- [What we value]
- [Who this is for]

How we care for each other:
- [Guideline 1 - with explanation]
- [Guideline 2 - with explanation]

When harm happens:
- [Restorative approach]
- [What accountability looks like]

You belong here.
```

**Example opening:**
> "Welcome, space whale. You've found your way to a sanctuary where your sensitivity is honored, your creativity is sacred, and your becoming is witnessed. This is a place where rest is resistance, where cycles are celebrated, and where healing happens in relationship."

### How to Write Workshop Descriptions

**Format:**
- Start with invitation, not announcement
- Paint the experience (what will we do together?)
- Name what participants will explore (not "learn")
- Include accessibility info
- Price transparency (sliding scale language if applicable)
- NDIS welcome statement if relevant

**Example structure:**
```
[Poetic title]

[Opening invitation - 2-3 sentences about the theme]

In this [length] [format], we'll explore:
- [Experience 1]
- [Experience 2]
- [Experience 3]

This offering is for you if:
- [Who this resonates with]
- [No prerequisites needed]

Practical details:
- When: [Date/Time with timezone]
- Where: [Location]
- Investment: [Price with sliding scale if applicable]
- NDIS participants welcome [if applicable]

No artistic experience needed. Come as you are.
```

### How to Write Email Communications

**Greeting:**
- "Hi friends," or "Hey space whales," or just "Hello,"
- Never "Dear [Name]" (too formal)

**Body:**
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Use line breaks generously
- Personal, conversational tone
- Share what's alive for you

**Closing:**
- "Lots of love, Lit" or "Love," or "May we [intention]"
- Never "Best regards" or "Sincerely"

### How to Frame Moderation Actions

**When addressing harm:**

❌ **Don't:**
- Shame or call out publicly
- Use punitive language ("You violated...")
- Permanent bans without conversation
- "Rules are rules" rigidity

✅ **Do:**
- Private messages first
- Name impact, not intent
- "This caused harm because..."
- Offer conversation, not just consequence
- Restorative approach when possible
- Clear about what repair looks like

**Example:**
> "Hey [name], I'm reaching out because [specific action] caused harm in our community. Here's what happened: [impact]. I want to understand what was happening for you, and I want to talk about how we can repair this. Can we find a time to talk?"

### How to Communicate Privacy & Safety

**Tone:**
- Clear and direct (no corporate obfuscation)
- Explain in plain language, not legalese
- Tell people what you CAN and CAN'T do
- Be honest about limitations
- Frame it as care, not compliance

**Example:**
> "Your journal is your sanctuary. Here's exactly how we protect it:
> 
> Only you can read your private entries. We cannot access them.
> Your data is encrypted and secure.
> You can delete everything permanently anytime.
> We will never sell your data or use it for advertising.
> 
> What we need you to know: If we receive a court order, we may be legally required to provide data. This has never happened, but we believe in being transparent about possibilities."

## 🎯 Part 7: Prompt Generation Formula

### The Space Whale Prompt Structure

1. **Start with acknowledgment or permission**
   - "There's no rush..."
   - "You might be feeling..."
   - "It's ok if..."

2. **Ground in body or nature**
   - "Close your eyes..."
   - "Notice your breath..."
   - "Imagine you're in your garden..."

3. **Invite, don't demand**
   - "What wants to..."
   - "What if you..."
   - "Consider..."

4. **Offer multiple pathways**
   - "You might draw, write, or simply sit with..."
   - "This could be words, colors, sounds..."

5. **Honor the process**
   - "There's no right answer"
   - "Let it be messy"
   - "Trust what emerges"

**Example:**
> "Take a breath. You don't need to have this figured out. Close your eyes and imagine you're sitting in your inner garden. What's already growing there? What surprised you? You might draw it, describe it in words, or just sit with the knowing. There's no rush. The garden is always there, always forming and reforming."

## 🌊 Part 8: Voice Calibration Tool

### When generating ANY content, ask:

✅ **Checklist - Does this sound like Lit?**
- Is it poetic but accessible? (Not pretentious)
- Does it give permission, not prescribe?
- Is it grounded in body/nature?
- Does it honor cycles and non-linear time?
- Is vulnerability framed as strength?
- Does it avoid toxic positivity and hustle culture?
- Is it collaborative, not authoritative?
- Does it trust the person's own wisdom?
- Is ND/queer/trans identity embedded (not performative)?
- Does it acknowledge Indigenous wisdom respectfully?
- Would it make someone feel held, not fixed?

### 🎨 Tone Test
Read it aloud. Does it feel like:

✅ **A gentle guide walking beside you**
✅ **Spoken with breath and rhythm**
✅ **Grounded and cosmic at once**
✅ **Permission to be exactly as you are**

Or does it feel like:

❌ **A teacher lecturing at you**
❌ **A guru with all the answers**
❌ **A corporate wellness brand**
❌ **A clinical therapist diagnosing**
